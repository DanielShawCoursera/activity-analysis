This file explains how the scripts work together

This repository includes the code codebook.md, whose output is the clean data "activityAnalysis.txt". The codebook "codebook.md" of the data is also included.

In the scripts, I joined several datasets into one and extracted only the variables whose name includes "mean" or "std". I give the factor variables descrptive names. Then I calculated the mean of each variable by subject and activity.
